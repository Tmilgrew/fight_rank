# fight_rank
This is a project I did for class and would like to expand upon.  The purpose was to write a program that shows visually how various algorithms work.
For this project, I chose merge sort, and I chose to use it with UFC fighers.  The program goes through their recored (I did the research, not pulled from a database) and gives them a new score based upon what I believe should be a new way to rank fighters.
The method doesn't take into consideration simple win/loss ratio, but rather how did they win/lose (Split decision, how many rds did they win, KO, were they fighting a top 10 guy, title fight, title defend, etc.)

Then merge sort is applied and the fighters are sorted according to their new rank.  According to this new ranking system, anderson silva is still at the top...where he should be.

More updates and bug fixes to come
